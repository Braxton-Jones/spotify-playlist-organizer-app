# .set("list") Another way to organize Spotify Playlists.

**Project Description:** 
.set("list") is a web application designed 
to simplify the process of organizing and managing your Spotify playlists. The idea 
for this project arose from my frustration of struggling to efficiently manage 
and curate playlists on the Spotify platform. The goal is to provide users with an 
intuitive and time-saving tool for maintaining their music collections.
