# .setlist - Spotify Playlist Manager

**Project Description:** 
.set("list") is a web application designed 
to simplify the process of organizing and managing your Spotify playlists. The idea 
for this project arose from my frustration of struggling to efficiently manage 
and curate playlists on the Spotify platform. The goal is to provide users with an 
intuitive and time-saving tool for maintaining their music collections.

## Roadmap

### Current Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can log in using their Spotify account to access their playlists.
- **View Playlists:** Users can view their existing playlists with the app.
- **Add and Remove Songs:** Users can add songs to their playlists and remove songs from them.

### Future Plans

- **Enhanced Editing and Adding Flow:** Improve the user flow for editing and adding songs to playlists, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Filtering Options:** Implement filters to allow users to quickly search and organize their playlists.
- **Genre Information:** Integrate another API that provides genre information for songs since Spotify only provides genres for artists. This will enhance the data available in the UI.
